       "'Seriously, if you are the kind of person who needs to understand where things came from to really understand them, this is a great book. It is truly a book on code, and not just \"how to code\" or \"what to do with code\" but \"what on earth is code\" and where did it come from. It explains computers and computing in more usable terms than more technical books on the same subject because it focuses on history and scope rather than technical depth. For a reader like me, who asked every teacher from elementary school through college \"why do we count to 10\" and clung to the best answer of \"it\\'s arbitrary - it\\'s just how it\\'s always been done\" until reading this book (and who struggled to convert binary to base ten), this book was gold. Pure gold. Okay, so I\\'m only 30 pages into this book but I\\'m hooked.  I started taking evening IT classes to get into a different career and ran into some issues in my A+ certification went they kept using volts, amperes and other terms that I only had a vague idea of what they meant.  This book gave me a more solid understanding of these terms, so much so I saved a friend $85 dollars that he was about spent on a starter for his car.  I saw immediately that the cable wire attached to the battery was missing a few inches of electrical tape, leaving the copper exposed.  This book taught me that electricity does not ran very well through air, so we went to Auto Zone and bought some electrical tape to cover the exposed areas, making sure enough electricity is getting to the battery.  I didn\\'t think it was going to work but the car started right up!  For a noob like me this was a big deal.  This author created a strong interest in me for chemistry, which would of been real helpful years ago but oh well.  I enjoyed his intro into Morse code and Brail as it felt he was conditioning readers to grasp idea how computers received and process information.  Brail was very interesting as he pointed out how certain markers will alert a blind person to cease '"

       "'No!!! So distracting. I get the idea of making learning fun, but fun doesn\\'t mean a thousand pages out of which only 200 are related to statistics. I only bought it because it was required for one of my classes. Sometimes professors don\\'t understand that not all students learn the same way and they don\\'t care if the book is expensive. Hello!!!! I\\'m a student with limited income?!! I don\\'t understand why most statistics books have a lot of bla bla bla. Would you just get to the point? I don\\'t have all day! This is the worst textbook I have ever read. This is written at a PHD level. Our professor that over looked the class advised me buying a different book because it was so confusing to learn from. I like that Andy uses plain speech to explain things. Some of his jokes are \"smirkable\".  However, the sex talk is not relatable or necessary.  I am no prude, if he had just dropped a few things here and there, I would have just thought, eh, not my taste and blown it off.  None of it is funny or arousing. It certainly doesn\\'t help me understand statistics any better.  In 2019, let\\'s let products sell themselves, sans sex! Worst textbook I have ever been forced to read for a class. Author spends most of the time talking about himself and his characters and less time teaching the facts. You get lost. Waste of money. The general quality of the book structure (not even the content- I\\'ll get to that) is terrible! The cover and pages are flimsy (I\\'ve ripped several pages just turning them) and there is some glossy coating on the pages that ensures reflections will appear on whatever area of the text is most difficult to understand. Did I mention flimsy? Do you remember the part in Men in Black where Will Smith was taking the exam will all the military guys and the tests were too flimsy and unshapely to be of any use? Those test designers also helped with this book. The internal layout is terrible. Three columns per page? Six per spread? \"Bolded\" words that are actually light blu'"
